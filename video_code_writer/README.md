# video_code_writer

when you are recording coding videos for the youtube or any other platform 

**sometime it is problematic to write fast code at some momonets 
using this code we can represent the code much faster and properly**

## 1. Save the code from writer.py - [url](https://github.com/rishabhjainfinal/some_random_projects/blob/main/video_code_writer/writer.py)
### Run the file

-p can be ['notepad','editor']

for help `python writer.py -h`


This commend will wait for the user to press enter after every para end  **'most used'**

`python writer.py -f <your file name> -p notepad`


This commend will not wait for you to keep pressing enter after every paragraph

`python writer.py -f <your file name> -p notepad -nw`
